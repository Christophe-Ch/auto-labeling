# AutoLabeling

_This project is a WIP._

AutoLabeling is a web app that allows you to label pictures for AI training way faster:

- Train a model with a few manually labeled pictures
- Export it to TFJS
- Import it into the _model_ folder
- Import pictures into _pictures/notEvaluated_
- `npm start` and go to `http://localhost:80`
- Click **accept** or **reject**

To create the base folder structure, just run `npm start`.

## Next steps

- Better UI
- Env file with paths, image size, label map, etc...
